### Whack-a-Mole

A fun arcade game built with modern web technologies that tests your reflexes.

## Description

Whack-a-Mole is a simple yet highly engaging and interactive arcade game developed with modern web technologies. Built with React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, and powered by Supabase on the backend, the game challenges players to click on randomly appearing moles before they disappear. As time passes, the speed at which the moles appear increases, pushing the player's reflexes to the limit.

The gameplay is intuitive and fun: moles pop up at random locations on the screen, and the player earns points by clicking them before they disappear. The game ends after a fixed period, at which point the player can enter their name and save their score to a leaderboard. This leaderboard is managed through Supabase, which handles data persistence using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).

## Core Features

- **Random Mole Spawning**: Moles appear randomly at different positions on the game board.
- **Score System**: Players accumulate points by successfully clicking on moles.
- **Speed Progression**: As the game advances, mole appearance intervals become shorter.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on all modern browsers and devices.
- **Leaderboard Integration**: Save and view top scores using Supabase.
- **Supabase Backend**: Uses RPC functions for efficient, scalable data handling.

### Technologies Used

# Frontend:

- **HTML**: Game structure and layout.
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **React + TypeScript**: Component logic, state management, timers, scoring.

# Backend:

- **Supabase**: Cloud-based backend with PostgreSQL and RPC functions.
- **Vite**: Lightweight and fast bundler with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Vite + React + TypeScript Setup

This project uses Vite for fast development and build processes. Two official plugins are supported:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: Uses SWC for faster performance.

## ESLint Configuration

To enable type-aware linting in production environments, extend the config with tseslint.config:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // or stricter:
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // optionally:
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

You can enhance linting with React-specific rules by installing:

```js
import reactX from "eslint-plugin-react-x";
import reactDom from "eslint-plugin-react-dom";

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    "react-x": reactX,
    "react-dom": reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    ...reactX.configs["recommended-typescript"].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
});
```
